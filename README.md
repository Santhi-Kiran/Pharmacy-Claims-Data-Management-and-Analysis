# Pharmacy-Claims-Data-Management-and-Analysis
This project involves setting up a test database for pharmacy claims data from a fictitious insurance company. The goal is to normalize the data, create a star schema, and develop SQL queries for future reporting needs.

Project Description
The Pharmacy Claims Data Management and Analysis project focuses on transforming raw pharmacy claims data into a structured relational database. It includes normalizing the data, creating a star schema in MySQL, and designing SQL queries for analytical reporting. This project helps in understanding the database structure and preparing for large-scale data analysis in production environments.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Normalize and structure pharmacy claims data.
Create a star schema for efficient data analysis.
Develop and test SQL queries for future reporting needs.
Files Included
fact_drug_insurance.csv: Contains the fact table for drug insurance payments.
dim_member.csv: Contains dimension data related to members.
dim_drug_details.csv: Contains dimension data related to drug details.
dim_drug_brand.csv: Contains dimension data related to drug brands.
Santhi Kiran_Chavali_Final_Project.sql: SQL script for setting up the database schema and queries.
Santhi Kiran_Chavali_Final_Project (3).docx: Project report detailing the database design, normalization process, and SQL queries.
How to Use
Review the Project Report: Start with the project report (Santhi Kiran_Chavali_Final_Project (3).docx) to understand the project's goals and implementation.
Set Up the Database: Use the SQL script (Santhi Kiran_Chavali_Final_Project.sql) to create the database schema and import the CSV files into MySQL.
Analyze the Data: Use the fact and dimension tables to run queries and analyze the data as described in the project report.
By following these steps, you can effectively use the files to understand and manage the pharmacy claims data, and prepare for future reporting and analysis.
